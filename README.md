# openbox-wm
This is my custom made openbox config files most of the polybar config files are taken from the Archcraft Linux and many other polybar configurations with some modifications and some addons

This version includes Openwm config for arch linux,ubuntu,debian but the default openbox config for arch and  debian remains the same. on ubuntu i have used dunst, xfce4-clipman instead of diodon. Incase we can use them as well.
